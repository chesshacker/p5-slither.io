# Slither.io using p5.js

I created this example for a short talk about [Docker][docker] to the [UTSA ACM
student chapter][acm]. My kids really like the game [slither.io][slither]! To
entertain them, and to hopefully make my example more engaging than hello world,
I thought I would make my own version of it using [p5.js][p5]. p5.js is a
JavaScript library to make drawing fun and easy.

## How to run or develop

Development requires either a recent version of Docker or Node. To start
development with Docker, run `docker-compose up`.

Once running, you should connect with your favorite web browser. I haven't done
a lot of browser compatibility testing... but a recent version of Chrome appears
to work well!
